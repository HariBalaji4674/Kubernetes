    Labels are key-Value pairs that are attached to pods 
    No Special Characters should be used
    Key can have multiple but vales should be unique

    annotations are also same like lables but labels have fixed( Minimal Length ) length but annotations cannot have fixed length in Annotations we can use links as values to download the resources but not in labels
