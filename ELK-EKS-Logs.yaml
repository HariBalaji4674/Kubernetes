What is EFK Stak:
  The EFK stack is a collection of open-source tools that are commonly used for log management and analysis. 

Elasticsearch: This is a distributed search and analytics engine that is used to store and index data.

Fluentd: This is a data collector that is used to aggregate logs from various sources, such as applications, servers, and network devices. 

Kibana: This is a web-based user interface that is used to visualize and analyze data stored in Elasticsearch.

Together, the EFK stack provides a powerful and flexible solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from multiple sources. 

It is often used in modern cloud-based environments, such as Kubernetes, to provide centralized logging and monitoring capabilities for applications and services.
