Prometheus Alerting and Monitoring:

Horizantal Pod AutoScaler:
    based on the cpu utilization ,memory utilization , network utilization
Ingress Controller:
    Classic Load Balancer and Application Load Balancer
    Application Load Balancer is Layer 7 Type

ArgoCd:

First Expose it to load Balancer

Then get the password:
    fAMxXfZxFOJZJpRM
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

Monitoring Application Metrics is More Important
Application Metrics and Cluster Metrics

1: JVM Metrics
2: Application Metrics (Logs,Variables)
3: Cluster Metrics
4: Log Metrics
5: CPU Usage
6: Memory Usage
7: Requests per minute and bytes per request
8: Latency and uptime
9: Security exposure
10: User satisfaction/Apdex scores
11: Average response time
12: Error rates
13: Garbage collection
14: Request rates

Prometheus:
Open-Source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit with an active ecosystem
    1: Analyse How your aplications and Infrastructure are performing from teh Metrics
    2: Prometheus Components are written in Go Language
    3: Uses MultiDimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key value pairs Eg :.. https_request_total{method =
    "get"}
    4: Out Of Box features : PromQL (Read-Only)
        Flexible Query Language
---------------------------------------------------
Installation of Prometheus:
    1: minikube start
    2: helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    3: helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
    4: kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-np
    5: kubectl get svc
    6: minikube service prometheus-server-np --url
---------------------------------------------------
Installation of Graphana:
    1: helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts

    2: helm install grafana grafana/grafana
    3: kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --target-port=3000 --name=grafana-np
    4: kubectl get services
    5: kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
    6: minikube service grafana-np --url

Prometheus-Notes:
   Collect Listen for events,typically with timestamp
   Effectively Store Those events in storage
   Should support querying feature
   Provide a Graphical Monitoring

Data Model
Stores Metrics in key-value pairs
Storage
---------------------------------------------------
Basics Terminologies of Prometheus:

Monotoring:
Monitoring is a systematic process of collecting and recording the activities taking palce in a target project, programmeor service and then using that record values to chek if the targets are reaching their objectives or not

Alerting:
An alert is the outcome of an alerting rule in prometheus that is actively firing
Alerts are sent from prometheus to teh alert manager

Alert Manager:
Prometheus-Server --> Alert-Manager --> Email,PagerDuty,Slack

Alert Manager manages the alerts from Prometheus-Server aggregate them into groups,de-duplicates,applie silences,throttels,and sends out the notifications to email,pagerDuty,Slack

Target:
Obeject to scrape
Its is a machine
whose metrics are to be monitored

Instance:
end point scrape

Job :
job is a collection of targets/instances with same purpose

Sample:
A sample is a single value at a point in timein timeseries

What are Exporters:
- To Monitor any application from prometheus we have to add Instruementation to the prometheus
- Client Libraries will help to make the application to monitor the applications
- Expirter is a Software or no of libraries and server
- Exporter helps in exporting existing metrics from 3rd party systems like Linux or Windows
- It will transform into a same format used for Prometheus Metrics
- It will be useful when the system is not able to connect directly with prometheus to get the metrics

Node-Exporters:
- Prometheus Exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by UNIX
- Exposes Kernel-level and Machine Level metrics on Unix Systems
- Metrics Such as CPU, Memory, Disk-Space Disk-I/O and Network Bandwidhth

Prometheus Query Language:

- Data-Type
  - Instant Vector:
    - A Set of time series containing a single sample for each time series all sharing the same timestamp
  - Range Vector:
    - A Set of time series conatining a range of data points over time for each time series
  - Scalar:
    - A simple numberic folating point of value
  - String:
    - A Simple String value

Selectors & Matchers:
- Expression {job="name of job"}
Matchers:
- Equality Matcher (=)
- Not Equality Matcher (!=)
- Regular Expression Matcher (=~)
- Not Regular Expression Matcher (!~)

Operators:
- Binary Operators : two Operands to do some task
  - Arithmatic Operators
  - Comparision Operators
  - LOgical Operators
  - Ignoring and On Operators
- Aggregation Operators:
  - Special Mathematical Functions that are used to combine information
  - Sum
  - max
  - min
  - avg
  - stdenv

Functions:
- Built-in Functions
- Rate Function rate()
- irate Function
- Change function
- deriv function : derivative how far that node is restarting with time intervals
- predict_linear
- avg_over_time
- count_over_time

Gauge Metrics:
- a Metric that represents a single value that can arbitrary go up and down
