Containers does not have full security problems

Why Docker is so famous?

Command
Containers
Docker File
Docker Engine

Stages in docker conatiners
---------------------------

Stage 1 --> Docker File --Run command docker build
stage 2 --> Image Creation -- docker run 
stage 3 --> containers -- Docker Images

Docker engine --> with commands

Docker is fully dependent on docker engines its like a heart of the docker systems

Buildah Is fully based on the Commands


Day 2 Docker Containerization:
------------------------------
Conatiners will take some 

Day 3 : Docker Multistage Builds
