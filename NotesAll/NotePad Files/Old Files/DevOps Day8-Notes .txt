Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy 
-------------------------------
Forward Proxy:
-------------

Proxy Means : a person who is given the power or authority to do something to someone/someother..
			  Proxy means instead of someone another one is doing something..
			  
Proxy Server : A server which contains set of protocols to be set by particular organisation

Forward Proxy Means: --> Moving Forward by accessing the proxy thing 
					    A Device/Protocols site between the users/clients and the Internet.
						
						Every Company using proxy servers to restrict their employees to use unrelated websites over work environment
						
Forward Proxy: Clients on the Private Network and Resources / Servers over the public/Internet 					
Client Infrastruture: Process Outgoing Requests from the clients 
					  Content Filtering (Censoring,Translation)
					  Logging
					  Monotoring
					  Caching 
					  Client Anonymization
						
						
Reverse Proxy : A Reverse Proxy is a server which sits behind the firewalls inside the private network and directs client requests to the appropriate Backend Server 

Reverse Proxy: Clients are on the internet and Resources / Servers are on the private network 
Server Infrastruture:
---------------------
					Process Incoming requests
					Load Balancing 
					Caching 
					Authentication
					Validation
					Encrypt and Decrypt SSL Communications
					DDoS Mitigation
					Stable Client End-Points and Changing Server Instances Endpoints
					A/B Testing 
****************************************************************************************************************
DDoS Protection: The process of successfully protecting the targeted server or network from a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack..

SSL : Secure Socket Layer 
	  It is a  protocol provides security/protection to the confidential data following the encryption process over the internet

Extra Configuration Information would always be stored in     /etc/nginx/default.d 

/etc/ --> Configuration Files required for the servers 

/usr/--> users share nginx html files 

============
MangoDB --> NoSql DataBases
RDBMS  ---> Relational DataBase Management System 
SQL DataBases.
NoSQL --> 

*********
SQL :

1) Uses Relational DataBase Management System
2) Vertically Scalable 
3) Fixed Schema
4) Can Be Used for complex quiries
5) Mostly Used for Banking Applications DataBases
6) Fixed Tables --> rows and columns


NoSql:

1) Uses Distributed DataBase Management System
2) Horizantally Scalabale
3) Dynamic Schema
4) Not Used for Complex Quiries
5) Mostly Used For E-Commerce Applications
6) Stored as Key-Value Pairs,Document Based,Graph DataBases,Wide-Column Stores

What is difference between Statefull and Stateless servers?

Network Protocols:
Network Protocols for a webbrowser and servers are classified as two types Stateless and Statefull

StateLess Protocols/Servers :
*****************************

1) State Means Data Stateless --> no storing of data 
2) It just follows request and response model and does not store any information
3) stateless protocols are : HTTP,HTTPS,UDP,DNS etc ..
4) Nginx and API Servers like Node.js , are the StateLess Servers 
5) Easy To Fetch data Based on the requirement as it does not store any information.


Statefull Protocols/servers :
*****************************

1) It saves the data based on the request send by the client 
2) it act as  Database Servers 
3) Statefull Protocols are : File Transfer Protocols,Transmission Control Protocol, TelNet etc ..
4) MongoDB and AmazonDynamo DB is StateFull Servers where it stores data 
5) Complex To retrieve data based on the quiries.
