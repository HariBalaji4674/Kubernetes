Loops in Shell Scripting:
-------------------------
Task: Install The multiple packages in one script using command line tool 

Algorithim:
----------
1. Check The user has root access or not 
2. Color the script based on the output 
3. take for loop and iterate over the packages giving over the cmd line 
4. if package is installed then give a comment like --> Packages is installed 
5. else install the packages 
6. Validate the installation in else condition by taking the function

						
####
#Need To check the root previlages

#!/bin/bash

userid=$(id -u)
R="\e[31m"
N="\e[0m"


if [ $userid -ne 0 ]
then 
	echo -e " $R Error ::$N You need to switch to root access"
fi

####
#Then add Those output to the logs in the file 

#!/bin/bash

Date=$(date +%F)
ScriptName=$0
LogDir=/home/centos/ShellFiles/LogFiles
LogFile=$LogDir/$ScriptName-$Date.log

user=$(id -u)
R="\e[31m"
G="\e[33m"
N="\e[0m"
Y="\e[33m"

if [ $user -eq 0 ]
then 
	echo -e "$R Error :: Please Change to Root $N Directory"
fi

# Validating The Softwares are installed Or not After Running The Command 

validation()
{
	if [ $1 -ne 0 ]
	then 
		echo -e  "Installing $2 .. $R Failure $N"
	else
		echo -e "Installing $2 .. $G Success $N"
	fi
}
#Checking the packages are installed or not

for i in $@
do
	yum install $i &>> $LogFile  # Should Give 0 or 1 if not 0 install else skip the package
	if [ $? -ne 0 ]
	then 
		echo -e "$i Is Not Installed ,Hence need To install"
		yum install $i -y &>> $LogFile # Should give the 0 or 1 if not 0 package is not installed else install 
		validation $? "$i" 
	else
		echo -e "$Y $i Softwares are installed ,So Please Skip it"
	fi
