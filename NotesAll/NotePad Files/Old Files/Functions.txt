Functions in Shell Scripting:
-----------------------------

function()
{
statements 1,
2,
3,
.....
}


we can do repeated steps in one function and can be re used several times.

yum install mysql -y

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then 
	echo "The Installation of Sql is Success"
else
	echo "The Installation of Sql Is falied"
fi

yum install postfix -y

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then 
	echo "The Installation of Sql is Success"
else
	echo "The Installation of Sql Is falied"
fi
**********************************************


can be replaced with below code by creating the function:

validation()
{
        if [ $1 -eq 0 ]
        then
                echo "$2 Is Success"
        else
                echo "$2 Is falied"
        fi
}

yum install mysql -y

validation $? "The Sql Installation "

yum install postfix -y

validation $? "The Postfix Installation"
