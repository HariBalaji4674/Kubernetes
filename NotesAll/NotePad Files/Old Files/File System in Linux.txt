File System In Linux
--------------------
/ (root filesystem): It is the top-level filesystem directory. It must include every file needed to boot the Linux system before another filesystem is mounted. Every other filesystem is mounted on a well-defined and standard mount point because of the root filesystem directories after the system is started.

/boot: It includes the static kernel and boot loader configuration and executable files needed to start a Linux 	computer.

/bin: This directory includes user executable files.Bianry Files Where all executable files stored 

/dev: It includes the device file for all hardware devices connected to the system. These aren't device drivers; instead, they are files that indicate all devices on the system and provide access to these devices.

/etc: It includes the local system configuration files for the host system.

/lib: It includes shared library files that are needed to start the system.

/home: The home directory storage is available for user files. All users have a subdirectory inside /home.

/mnt: It is a temporary mount point for basic filesystems that can be used at the time when the administrator is working or repairing a filesystem.

/media: A place for mounting external removable media devices like USB thumb drives that might be linked to the host.

/opt: It contains optional files like vendor supplied application programs that must be placed here.
	  3rd party files/progrms are stored here 

/root: It's the home directory for a root user. Keep in mind that it's not the '/' (root) file system.

/tmp: It is a temporary directory used by the OS and several programs for storing temporary files. Also, users may temporarily store files here. Remember that files may be removed without prior notice at any time in this directory.

/sbin: These are system binary files. They are executables utilized for system administration.

/usr: They are read-only and shareable files, including executable libraries and binaries, man files, and several documentation types.

/var: Here, variable data files are saved. It can contain things such as MySQL, log files, other database files, email inboxes, web server data files, and much more.


find command
------------
find <search directory> -f <File/directory name>


Inode,Softlink, hard Link
-------------------------

inode --> the place where the file/directory stored in the linux system --> which give one numerical number
inode <filename> --> returns file number
softlink --> the link which refers to the inode is called the softlink and will lost acces when original file deleted 

ln -s <file location> <linkname>

hard link --> the link created to copy the original file with inode and will niot lost acces even original file removed 
ln <file location>  <new file name>
