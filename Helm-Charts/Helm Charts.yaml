Helm Concepts: Helm Commands
Helm Install Command:
  helm repo list
  helm repo add REPO-NAME REPO-URL
  helm search repo <commands>
  helm search repo nginx
  helm install release-name chart-name
  helm list
  helm unistall <release-name>

Practical Installation:




In all Kubernetes and Docker we are doing only two things Building Images and Running that Images

Entire Manifest Files Are Static Except Images

Building image
Manifest --> How to Run Images --> Input Latest Version

We Will Keep The important files aside and edit required Files

Variables: Dry Without Interupting actual code or no hardcoding each and every place we use Variables

Helm Charts:
    What ever changing constantly we need to create variables
Purpose of helm is 2 Things:
    Parameterizing the Kubernetes Manifest Files
    Packages the kubernetes Manifest Files

Installing Helm : 3 Commands:
    Installed Helm 3
Structure of Helm:
    *1) Charts --> Where all Chart related content stored.
    *2) template--> Whee all manifest files stored
     3)
Chart.yaml: Mandatory file

Charts:
    apiVersion: Version of
    name: Name od Charts
    version: chart version
    description: "This is helm chart of nginx"
    api
    appVersion: application version

How to run the helm chats :
  helm install <chart-name> --> To run the chart

Parameterizing the image values:
Create the values.yaml file :
  add all the repeatedly chainging values like below
  Variables: {{.values.deployment.imageVersion}}

Helm History <chart-name> --> To Check The history for deployment
helm list
helm install nginx . (period same directory)
helm upgrade <chart-name> .
helm rollback <chart-name>
helm histroy <chart-name>

elastic search and prometheus :
  1: image should be available
  2: You should know how to create and run the manifest files
