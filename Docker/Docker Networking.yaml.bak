Networking --> communication between two hosts/devices over wired /wireless
Docker: 
    Docker is Platform where it implements the Containerization
    Docker Networking is Communication between two docker containers
Docker Network:
    There are two types of communication
        1) Container 1 
        2) Container 2

How Containers will communicate with Host Systems:
    Docker will create one network called Virtual etho 0 that is docker0 ---> that will connect with the Host eth0 and makes the communication this is called bridge networking 
    
There are three Types of Networking in Docker Containers:
    Bridge Networking
    Host Networking
    OverLay Networking (Docker Swarm)

Custom Bridge networking:
    Create Custom Virtual ETH0 To connect with host eth0 to implememt complete isolation between two containers located in same docker engine and host
Network Commands:
    can do CRUD Operations:
    docker network create secure-network 
    docker network ls
    docker network inspect
    docker network bridge 
    docker run -d --name finance --network=secure-network nginx:latest
Why you need networking on Docker :
    Docker networking enables a user to link a Docker container to as many networks as he/she requires. Docker Networks are used to provide complete isolation for Docker containers. 

Which Network Model is docker is following and give me some advantages :

    Container network  model it is following
    the implementation of CNM specification by docker is called libnetwork
How types of blocks involved in docker libnetwork:
    Networks : Software implementation of switch ,used for grouping and isolate the collection of endpoints  
    Endpoints : Virtual Network Interfaces , used for Making the connections
    Sandboxes : Isolated Network Stack (Routing, Switching etc..)
